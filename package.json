  "description": "This is a blockchain-based decentralized house listing service. I built this repo is for Udacity's capstone project. It builds upon the knowledge I gained in the nanodegree course in order to build a decentralized housing product.  \r In this project, proprietary tokens are minted to represent titles to the properties. Before minting a token, it verifies that the property is rightfully owned by claiming client(i.e. me, or whoever is running the DAPP). I used zk-SNARKs to create a verification system which can prove title ownership to the property without revealing that specific information on the property.",
